      <h2>My Journey as a Developer</h2>
      <p>I have been taking computer science classes since 2021 through Towson University. However, this is my first web programming class. The language that I feel most comfortable programming in is Java thanks to 
      my introductory programming courses at Towson University. I already had exposure to some of the topics in this class thanks to my job with the company AI Code Academy teaching children programming & math.</p>

      <h2>My Journey as a Student & Individual</h2>
      <p>I have been studying computer science at CCBC since Winter 2024. I graduate this semester with my associates degree in Computer Science! I was able to graduate in less than 
      a year because of my credits transferring from Towson University. I plan on graduating with my bachelors degree in Computer Science in May of 2026 if I do not take a job
      teaching elementary school - which I am currently considering right now!</p>

      <p>If I take the elementary school teaching position I plan on trying to integrate my background in computer science into my lessons!</p>

      <p>The last thing that I would like to share about myself is that I have been working at CCBC Dundalk as a math & science tutor while studying at CCBC. I enjoy the CCBC Dundalk 
      campus - it is actually my favorite CCBC campus.</p>

            <h3>I chose to make a website with an image of Towson University's Tiger logo because I am excited to resume taking classes 
                at Towson University after leaving in 2023. I like this logo of Towson University because I think that the 
                tiger is cute. The sleek design and colors of the logo as well as the fact that it is an animal makes me 
                like the image. </h3>

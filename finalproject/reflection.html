      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>A major challenge that I had with this project is getting the black shading effect to show on all websites. I had added this to a website before in lb04, but I was having 
        trouble transferring the formatting to this lab. Some of the triumphs that I had during this project include the amount of material that I already had ready to use thanks 
        to me completing past labs. A lot of the techniques that I learned over the semester were easily and quickly incorporated into this assignment.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the observations that I had from testing on multiple browsers is that the page adapts nicely on mobile phones thanks to the media screen code on my style.css page.
        In the course as a whole I learned many many new topics. My favorite things to learn about include creating and formatting tables, inserting and styling images on a webpage, 
        and creating a navigation menu at the top of a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the things that were challenging for me throughout the semester include keeping the tags properly closed. Many times I would close the tags in the wrong place. 
        I also struggled with the validator. Often I would have many warnings and errors from the validator that I struggled to fix.

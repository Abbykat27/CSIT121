            <h3>I chose to make a website with an image of Towson University's Burdick Hall & Liberal Arts Building
                because I will be reenrolling at Towson University this summer, summer 2025, and I am excited to 
                return to campus after leaving in 2023. I enjoy using Towson University's gym, which is located
                in Burdick Hall.
            </h3>

            <p id="Athletics">Not only does Towson University have a gym, but they have a lot of college level sports that students 
                & the general public can watch. Below are links to their games:

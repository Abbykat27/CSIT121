            <h3>I chose to make a website with an image of a walkway at Towson University because I think that the fall colors and trees
                in the image are pretty. I also enjoy walking the campus of Towson University. Lastly, I chose this image because I resume
                my classes at Towson University after taking my last class there in 2023 and I am excited to be back! Go Tigers!</h3>

            <p id="Athletics">Here is a linkt to a website that includes a picture of another beautiful walkway at Towson University:

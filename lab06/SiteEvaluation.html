            <h2 id="secondary-heading">What is the URL of the website?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>https://schultzscrabhouse.com/</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">What is the name of the website?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Schultz's Crab House</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">Who is the site's target audience?</h2>
            
            <p>Anyone that enjoys eating seafood or American comfort food.</p>
            
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">How is the site organized?</h2>
            <p>The website has a hierarchial organization. With the homepage being the Schultz Crab House mainpage. The homepage
                contains navigation links to the major site sections history, merchandise, and gallery. This site is organized
                well becasue it contains a maximum of three hyperlinks.
            </p>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">Which CRAP Design Principle does the use? Provide at least one example.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Contrast: two items are not exactly the same, make them different. REALLY DIFFERENT!</li>
                <p>The title of the webpage and the navigation links are all surrounded by black boxes while the rest of the 
                    website is surrounded by a white background. This creates a contrast that makes it easy to distinguish
                    the navigation links from the "meat" of the webpage. 
                </p>

                <li>Repetition: you repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire peice</li>
                <p>There is a repeated theme of using black, white, and organe colors throughout the website. 
                    The text is always written in black and the background is always white on every page of the website.
                    The navigation links are always organge when you hover over them. 
                </p>

                <li>Proximity: related items are grouped together and unrelated items are not grouped together.</li>
                <p>In the gallery page all of the images of the resturant and food are grouped together, on the merchandise 
                    page all of the shirts that are for sale are grouped together, and on the history page images of the 
                    origins of the resturant as well as text that writes about the history of the resutrant are all grouped 
                    together.
                </p>
            </ol>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker</h2>
            <p>The audit score is 69% with the website needing to ensure links have discernible text, ensure that
                links are distinguishable from surrounding text in a way that does not rely on color, and ensure touch 
                target has sufficient size and space.
            </p>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h2>
            <p>The site is very effective. The hyperlinks are clearly labeled with the page that it will take someone to. For example,
                the link to the webpage that holds the images is clearly labeled gallery for the user to clock and follow. It is 
                easy to read the text on the different webpages because of the contrast created by choosing the background to be white 
                in color and the text to be black. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?</h2>
            <p>Users can read the website efficiently becasue the text is easy on the eye and formatted well in paragraphs. All 
                links to other webpages are in the top right hand corner of the webiste making it easy to switch between
                webpages as all hyperlinks are in one convenient location. All of the images are easy to understand with text that 
                describes each image popping up when you hover over the image.
            </p>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h2>
            <p>I think that it is pleasant to use and appropriate for the resturant industry. However, the menu could be included
                on the webpage. It is a resturant industry standard for their websites to include the menu on them. Schultz does not 
                include its menu on their website. Otherwise, the images of their food on the gallery webpage pleasantly show 
                potential customers food that they could order at the resturant.
            </p>
            <h2 id="secondary-heading">Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h2>
            <p>Schultz website could implement some of the website best practices outlined in this module. For example, in the history 
                section of their website the text that describes each image could be bullet pointed. The website could also use subheadings. 
                The website did not have any subheadings. Another recommendation is that the image file size should be as small as possible 
                with acceptable display qualtiy. The images on this website to not have acceptable display quality because they are too small.

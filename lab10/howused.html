            <p id="why-chose">Applications of Geolocation</p>
            

            <h3>One application of geolocation is health services. Health providers can use geolocation data to improve their emergency services to reach patients faster. 
                For example, accurate location data lets emergency medical teams reach patients with critical health issues sooner. A second application of geolocation 
                is finance. 
            </h3>

            <h3>Geolocation makes fraud detection easier for companies. Users can recieve notifications when unauthorized devices from uncommon locations use their 
                payment methods. A third application is retail. Businesses are able tailor their marketing strategies depending on the physical location of their customers.
                For example, e-commerce companies like Amazon use geolocation data to locate their customers.
            </h3>
            
            <h3>A fourth application of geolocation is logistics. Route optimization and incident management in supply chains need precise geolocation data. The information 
                is used to address delays in delivery goods and services faster. For example, a trucking company could have vehicles break down, creating supply chain issues. 
                Geolocation data could be used to help dispatchers quickly locate the truck and send a repair team to fix it.

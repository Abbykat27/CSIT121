            <p id="why-chose">Real-Time Fleet and Vehicle Safety</p>
            <h3>Geolocation is important because it allows for the safety of vehicles and fleets of vehicles in real-time. This can be life saving 
              because paramedics and an incident response team will be able to reach the scene much faster with real-time data. For example, a cargo
            ship at sea, with the use of geolocation, can provide GPS coordinates to a repair team & paramedics. The difference in response time 
             can make a world of a difference for the wellp-being of the victims on the ship. </h3>

            <p id="why-chose">Fraud Detection</p>
            <h3>Geolocation is important because it allows for fraud detection. A user can pair a device, such as a smartphone, with a specific form of payment, such 
              as a credit card. If someone attempts to use this card with a different device, geolocation data can alert the cardholder to the new location
            that their credit card is being used at. The cost of credit card fraud globally is estimated to be 33 billion dollars.</h3>

            <p id="why-chose">Increasing Efficiency</p>
            <h3>Geolocation is important because it allows for higher efficiency. Logistics and delivery companies can perform real-time tracking. They 
              are able to optimize routes. Optimized routes allow for goods to be delivered quicker and for location-based services to be performed quicker.

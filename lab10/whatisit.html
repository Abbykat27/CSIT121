          <p id="why-chose">Explanation of Geolocation in Websites</p>
          <h3>It is a technology that identifies the physical location of devices and people based on their 
            geographic coordinates and IP addresses. Most of the time, in order for this technology to work the device must be 
            connected to the internet. However, an internet connection is not needed for GPS-enabled devices becasue 
            they use satellite signals to determine locations. The step-by-step process in geolocation is as follows: 
            <ol> 
              <li>Collection: device collects raw data about its location from multiple source: sending GPS signals, Wi-Fi pings, and cellular data exchanges</li>
              <li>Transmission: raw data is sent to the central server or cloud infrastructure that operates a geolocation application</li>
              <li>Triangulation: using this raw data, the device determines its location by measuring its distance from cell towers, satellites, or Wi-Fi access points</li>
              <li>Processing: algorithms process the raw data to produce accurate location data</li>
            </ol>
          </h3>

            <p id="why-chose">Limitations of Geolocation</p>
            <h3>There are multiple factors that contribute to the accuracy of a device's geolocation reading. The different factors are the device type, data collection method, 
              and surrounding envrionment. Mobile devices generally provide better geolocation results than stationary devices because they usually have built-in GPS sensors
              and more constant cellular/Wi-Fi connectivity. The data collection matters because each method is not the same in accurary. For example, IP geolocation is usually 
              less accurate than network connections. Lastly, the surronding environment matters. Urban environments typically have more cell towers in the area as compared to 
              rural envrionments, enchancing the accuracy of geolocation data.
            </h3>

              <p id="why-chose">Geolocation Privacy Issues</p>
            <h3>Geolocation data is considered sensitive information. If this information got into the wrong hands it could put someone in a dangerous position. 
              Therefore, organizations that handle geolocation data use security software tools and methods to safeguard the information. However, misuse is not 
              limited to outside sources. Sometimes the organizations that collect the data are the culprits. For example, in the past organizations have not 
              been up-front about how they plan on using the data.
